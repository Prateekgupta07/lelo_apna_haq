Tips for using mathsUnit1.py: -
  -> for variable, always use small alphabet 'x'
  -> for any mathematical operation, python language should be used like: -
      -> x^y should be written as x**y
      -> for exponential, trigonometric, or logarithmic function, we should write as 'math.e**x', 'math.log(x,base)' , math.sin(x)
